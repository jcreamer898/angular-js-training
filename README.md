# Angular.js Training
This is the training content for my jQuery UK 2015 workshop, and 2014 DevLink.

There are 4 labs in the `labs` directory. The instructions are in each folder.

Each of the labs will be named `lab1.html`, `lab2.html`, etc. You can either open the
lab file directly in the browser, or start up an HTTP server with...

```shell
cd labs
npm install -g simple-http-server
nserver -p 8000
```

The browse to http://localhost:8000.

Have fun!
